  summary:
    "I'm someone who is in awe of technology. I can't explain it. No, I mean it. I actually can't. I struggle to put into words how amazed I am every day by every day things we take for granted. Technology and engineering humble me. Everywhere I look and everything I look at is a result of decades of continuous engineering powered by an incessant need for ruthless optimisation. I feel an inexplicable high when I wonder what my contribution will be to this giant repository that is changing with every creation, deployment and iteration. When I'm not staring at a screen, I stare outside a window thinking of the trolley problem. When I'm not staring outside a window, I go back to staring at a screen where I write code to develop software, analyze historical market data or play chess. Jokes aside - I'm always looking for a chess opponent. So please don't hesitate to reach out :)",
